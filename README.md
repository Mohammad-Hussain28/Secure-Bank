# Core Azure Services :
**Azure Storage :**

Azure Storage is instrumental in a bank's website infrastructure, delivering secure and scalable solutions for diverse data. Utilizing Azure Blob Storage ensures secure storage of customer documents and files. Azure Table Storage supports structured data, facilitating efficient storage of critical financial information. With features like Azure Backup, it enables reliable data backup and swift recovery. Highly scalable, it accommodates evolving data volumes seamlessly. Integration with various Azure services forms a comprehensive ecosystem. Robust security measures, compliance support, and features like Azure CDN enhance data confidentiality, integrity, and content delivery. Azure Storage is foundational, offering a feature-rich storage solution crucial for data management, compliance, and optimal website performance.

 

**Azure VM :**

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are integral to a bank's website infrastructure, providing globally accessible web hosting and facilitating application deployment. Key features include auto-scaling for efficient resource management during variable traffic, hosting database servers for customer data storage, and handling secure backend processing, such as transaction verification. VMs benefit from Azure's robust security measures, including firewalls and network security groups. Seamless integration with Azure services, support for compliance standards, and features like availability sets and Azure Backup contribute to high availability, regulatory compliance, and effective monitoring, ensuring a reliable and scalable foundation for the bank's online operations.


**Azure V-Net :**

Azure's Virtual Network (VNet) is pivotal for a bank's website, delivering a secure and segmented network environment. VNet ensures resource isolation, fortifying the website's security. Network Security Groups (NSGs) add an extra layer of protection, controlling traffic for sensitive financial data. Enabling VPNs and ExpressRoute guarantees secure connectivity to on-premises networks, facilitating smooth integration. Integration with Azure services through Service Endpoints and Private Link ensures private and secure data access. VNet supports scalability through subnet configuration, load balancing with Azure Load Balancer, and hybrid cloud scenarios. It also aids compliance by providing network isolation, cementing its role in ensuring a robust, compliant, and optimized network foundation for online banking.
